## Usage

ECM shadow tokens were created as drop shadows, the most common shadow type in digital design. A drop shadow is an effect caused by light from above that projects a shadow of the layer above onto the layer below, giving the impression of depth and hierarchy.

The elevation between two components along the z-axis determines the level of shadow.

Shadow hierarchy must always be respected: bottom components have less shadow than the ones on top.

### When to use

- Use shadows on components when elevation is needed to give a sense of depth.
