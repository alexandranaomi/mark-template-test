Tokens store style values like colors and fonts so the same values can be used across designs, code, tools, and platforms.

### What are design tokens??

> Design tokens are the visual design atoms of the design system â€” specifically, they are named entities that store visual design attributes. We use them in place of hard-coded values (such as hex values for color or pixel values for spacing) in order to maintain a scalable and consistent visual system for UI development.

#### Salesforce, [Lightning Design System](https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/design-tokens/#openInNewTab)

The term "design token" was created by the Salesforce design system team in 2014.

Design tokens are variables that store visual design attributes, such as colors and typography, which can be used to style and build cross-platform User Interfaces (UI). They are the tiniest element of a design system and represent repeated design decisions.

Design tokens have meaningful names to reflect visual styles in an agnostic way, instead of using hard-coded values. This allows them to be exported in a variety of formats and to be used in various design and development tools, whether to build an Android, iOS, software or web application.

### Why are tokens important?

The main goal of design tokens is to create a scalable and consistent visual system for UI development across all product experiences. Given that design tokens represent a single source of truth, they ensure that the product's UI is coherent and design elements are uniform in all platforms.

Additionally, design tokens can be stored and managed in a design system, making it easier for designers and developers to maintain and update a product's visual design. They may simply modify the design token in a central spot (as a code repository), and the change will be synchronized, saving them the trouble of searching through the code or design files for every instance of a specific attribute to replace its value.

Using design tokens to optimize the design and development process reduces the chance of errors or inconsistencies, promotes reuse of design decisions, and gives design systems flexibility to scale.

### Design Token types

![token-types](../assets/token-types.png#expand)

To help guide naming conventions and also serve as building blocks, design tokens are divided into three categories:

#### 1. Global or Foundation tokens (1st layer):

<Container width={90}>

Global tokens are the fundamental type of design tokens and are used to store a single value that will be applied consistently across the whole product. Therefore, they must be represented by context-agnostic names. Some global tokens are color, typography (font sizes, font families, font weights, etc.), spacing (margin, padding, size), shadow (blur, spread, color), border (width, style, color), elevation, opacity, iconography, animation, and utility tokens (breakpoints, z-index, responsive design values). They are inherited by all other token types but may be directly applied as well.

Example: `color.global.groupblue.75: #1D4C84`

</Container>

#### 2. Alias or Semantic tokens (2nd layer):

<Container width={90}>

Alias tokens communicate a token's intended purpose in a specific context in the UI. They are used to define global meaning, function or appearance and to create references to other design tokens.

Example: `color.background.primary.normal: --global.blue.75`

</Container>

#### 3. Component tokens: (3rd layer):

<Container width={90}>

Component tokens are a comprehensive representation of all elements and values associated with a component, such as variants and states for a button. They should derive from alias tokens and must be named in a way that development teams may clearly understand their application.

Example: `button.container.color.background.normal: --color.background.primary.normal`

</Container>

#### 4. Theming tokens:

<Container width={90}>

Theming tokens are a group of semantic tokens gathered to create a theme, especially of colors and modes (light,dark, accessibility).

In EMR Design Tokens there are 4 categories of color themes:

- Colors: Aqua, Blue, Green, Grey, Group-Blue, Orange, Pink, Purple
- Accent Colors: Aqua, Green, Orange, Pink, Purple
- Navigational tonal ranges: Ultra-light, Very-Light, Bright, Very-Dark
- Content tonal ranges: Ultra-light, Very-Light, Bright, Very-Dark

They may be combined to create a customized theme, e.g. `ecm.blue_green_bright_ultra-light`.
